# Vanilla-JS-Calculator
F&amp;C training project - virtual calculator

#WARNING Work in progress - may be updated at any time.

#DESCRIPTION 
A simple virtual calculator based on vanilla JavaScript and CSS. (Note on colour scheme: I sampled all colours from vanilla ice cream, pistachio ice cream, chocolate fudge etc.as a bit of a joke, because this is simply one version of a training project.)
